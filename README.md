# OSE course

We teach basic software engineering, numerical methods, and computational engineering skills. This allows you to to leverage tools from computational science and increase the transparency and extensibility of our implementations. In doing so, you expand the set of possible economic questions that you can address and improve the quality of your answers.

Throughout the course we will make heavy use of [Python](https://www.python.org) and its [SciPy ecosystem](https://www.scipy.org) and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org). A basic knowledge of the tool chain is a prerequisite. There exist numerous introductory resources and we provide a curated list [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/general-resources).

We will use [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/) for all communications. This includes administrative issues, but also resources to follow up. Please be sure to join us [here](https://ose.zulipchat.com/join/dw3ysawvg0dg3c92uwkf68c6).

## Basic outline

We organize the course around the two flagship codes of our group. After a brief introduction to the class and our initiative, we use two of our flagship codes to explore selected issues in software engineering, numerical methods, and computational engineering.

### Introduction to OpenSourceEconomics

We provide a general introduction to computational modeling in economics and the `OpenSourceEconomics` initiative. We outline opportunities for students to get involved.

### `respy`

We maintain a Python package for the simulation and estimation of a prototypical finite-horizon dynamic discrete choice model based on Keane & Wolpin (1997). We first outline an overview on underlying economic, mathematical, and computational model. We then provide an overview on its applications in economics. Finally, we `respy` to discuss selected issues such as numerical integration, parallelization strategies, version control, software testing, and continuous integration. Additional information about the project is available in our [online documentation](https://respy.readthedocs.io).

### `estimagic`

We maintain a Python package that helps to build high-quality and user friendly implementations of (structural) econometric models. We provide additional details in the [online documentation](https://estimagic.readthedocs.io).
